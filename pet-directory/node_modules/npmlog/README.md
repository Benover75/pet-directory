# npmlog

The logger util that npm uses.

This logger is very basic.  It does the logging for npm.  It supports
custom levels and colored output.

By default, logs are written to stderr.  If you want to send log messages
to outputs other than streams, then you can change the `log.stream`
member, or you can just listen to the events that it emits, and do
whatever you want with them.

# Installation

```console
npm install npmlog --save
```

# Basic Usage

```javascript
var log = require('npmlog')

// additional stuff ---------------------------+
// message ----------+                         |
// prefix ----+      |                         |
// level -+   |      |                         |
//        v   v      v                         v
    log.info('fyi', 'I have a kitty cat: %j', myKittyCat)
```

## log.level

* {String}

The level to display logs at.  Any logs at or above this level will be
displayed.  The special level `silent` will prevent anything from being
displayed ever.

## log.record

* {Array}

An array of all the log messages that have been entered.

## log.maxRecordSize

* {Number}

The maximum number of records to keep.  If log.record gets bigger than
10% over this value, then it is sliced down to 90% of this value.

The reason for the 10% window is so that it doesn't have to resize a
large array on every log entry.

## log.prefixStyle

* {Object}

A style object that specifies how prefixes are styled.  (See below)

## log.headingStyle

* {Object}

A style object that specifies how the heading is styled.  (See below)

* {String} Default: ""

If set, a heading that is printed at the start of every line.

## log.stream

* {Stream} Default: `process.stderr`

The stream where output is written.
