# Project Reflection: 3D Calculator

## Design Philosophy
- The goal was to create a calculator that feels futuristic, beautiful, and highly usable.
- The black-on-stone-black palette with glassmorphic effects was chosen for a modern, premium look.
- Navigation is handled by a navbar to avoid scrolling, per user preference, and to keep the experience focused and fast.

## Development Process
- Started with a React PWA template for modern web standards and offline support.
- Built the UI from scratch, focusing on glassmorphism: blur, transparency, gradients, and neon highlights.
- Implemented a flexible layout that adapts to both desktop and mobile, with responsive breakpoints.
- Added all calculator logic in React state, supporting both standard and scientific operations, memory, and history.
- Iteratively refined the UI based on feedback: button sizing, layout, scroll/no-scroll, and accessibility.

## Challenges
- Balancing a no-scroll, fit-to-page layout with usability and accessibility on all devices.
- Ensuring the calculator logic is robust, especially for scientific expressions and chaining operations.
- Making the UI both visually stunning and highly usable, with clear feedback and modern effects.
- Handling edge cases in history, memory, and user input.

## What Went Well
- Achieved a unique, glassy, and modern look that stands out from typical calculators.
- The app is highly modular, making it easy to extend and maintain.
- User feedback was incorporated quickly, leading to a more polished and user-friendly product.

## Future Ideas
- Add keyboard support and accessibility improvements.
- Support for more advanced scientific functions (factorial, hyperbolic, etc.).
- Persistent history and memory (localStorage).
- Theming (light/dark, color accents).
- Animations for button presses and transitions.
- Internationalization and localization.

## Open Source Impact
- This project is intended as a showcase for modern web UI/UX and as a useful tool for the community.
- Contributions, feedback, and forks are encouraged to help the project grow and improve.
